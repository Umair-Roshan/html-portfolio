    <h1> Yo what's up guys this is what I think are the 5 top best movies (in my opinion):</h1>
    <h2>No.05: The Avengers Film Series </h2>
    <p> Marvel dropped this bomber of a series of movies. It started with The Avengers in 2012 and ended in Avengers Endgame and let me tell you. The way they ended the series was beautiful and it was pure cinema</p>
    <h2>No.04: Spirit Stallion</h2>
    <p> The animations, the music, the story. I can keep on going about this old movie but I'm gonna keep it short. Everything about this movie is a masterpiece and was beautifully sculpted</p>
    <h2>No.03: Deadpool Film Series</h2>
    <p>Now I know deadpool is r-rated but still it was really good. It's abot this crazy mutant guy who has regenarative properties kinda like wolverine and it is hilarious and whats better is he breaks the 4th wall and comunicates with the audience also which is another power of deadpool in the comics where he can knows that he lives in a fictional world.</p>
    <h2>No.02: Puss In Boots 2</h2>
    <p>Dam this movie was good. Nobody expected a cartoon meant for kids to go this kid but the producers of the movie cooked and we the audience ate it!</p>
    <h2>No.01: Interstellar</h2>
    <p>There are no words to describe this movie. This was peak cinema, beautifully woven story. It talks about the universe and how vast it is. I know i am describing in a simplified version. Dont come after me! XD</p>
